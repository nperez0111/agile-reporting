# Data Storage and IO operations

If you look at the `index.js` in this directory you will see some sample starter code I wrote for you to begin off of.

I'd like this README file to be updated to be a description of what it is that this portion of the project is accomplishing and how to use it.

This will be used by your teammates to actually use your code to wire things together.
