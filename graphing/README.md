So I set up an express server for you to start off with. I won't go into too much detail on it.
All you need to know is that running `npm start` in this directory will start the server at: `http://localhost:3000/`
From there any modification you make to `html/index.html` just needs to be refreshed in the browser to be seen.

Your main working directory is inside `html/`.
