# Graphing

So I set up an express server for you to start off with. I won't go into too much detail on it.
All you need to know is that running `npm start` in this directory will start the server at: `http://localhost:3000/`
From there any modification you make to `html/index.html` just needs to be refreshed in the browser to be seen.
Another thing to note is that the data will be loaded from the server so if you open up that file I have written just one data point to work off, you should create more to test your graph.

Your main working directory is inside `html/`.
