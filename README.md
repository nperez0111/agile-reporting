# AgileMD Reporting Project

All work is going to be made via Pull Requests from a non-master branch to the master branch where it will be reviewed.

To create a branch that is not master from your terminal:

* `cd` into the folder that holds this repository
  * if you do not have it already: `git clone https://github.com/nperez0111/agile-reporting.git`
* `git branch <branchname>` to create a branch (name does not matter too much)
* do your work saving files as you go.
* to create a commit: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
* to push up to GitHub: `git push -u origin <branchname>`

At the time of writing we are going to split this project up into 3 sections: Input/Output and Storage, Graphing, Image Generation.

## Input/Output and Storage

You will be working in the `io` directory for now and will find more detailed information in the `README.md` located in there.

## Graphing

You will be working in the `graphing` directory for now and will find more detailed information in the `README.md` located in there.

## Image Generation

You will be working in the `image` directory for now and will find more detailed information in the `README.md` located in there.
